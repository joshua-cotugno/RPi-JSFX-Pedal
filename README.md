# Raspberry Pi based JSFX Controller

To run a standalone JSFX app on a Raspberry Pi with audio input from a HAT and a web interface for control, you can follow these general steps:
Set up the Raspberry Pi:
Install an operating system on your Raspberry Pi, such as Raspbian or Raspberry Pi OS.
Configure the Raspberry Pi to work with your HAT for audio input. Refer to the documentation of your specific HAT for instructions on setting it up correctly.
Install Node.js and NPM:
Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
Run the following commands to install Node.js and NPM:
Create a directory for your JSFX app:
Use the terminal to navigate to the desired location where you want to store your JSFX app.
Create a new directory for your app, for example:
Set up the web interface:
Create a new file called index.html in the jsfx-app directory and write the necessary HTML and CSS code for your web interface. This file will serve as the main interface for controlling your JSFX effects.
Use JavaScript in the HTML file to send requests to your JSFX app for controlling the effects. You can use libraries like Axios or fetch to make HTTP requests to your JSFX app's API.
Set up the JSFX app:
Create a new file called app.js in the jsfx-app directory.
Write the necessary JavaScript code using a web framework of your choice (e.g., Express.js) to handle the API endpoints and interact with the JSFX engine.
Use the jsfx library or any other audio processing library to handle the audio effects and signal processing. You can refer to the previous JSFX example I provided for guidance.
Install dependencies and start the server:
In the terminal, navigate to the jsfx-app directory.
Run npm init to initialize a new Node.js project and follow the prompts.
Install the necessary dependencies, including your chosen web framework and any additional libraries you're using. For example, if you're using Express.js, run npm install express.
Start the server by running node app.js or use a process manager like PM2 to keep the server running in the background.
Access the web interface:
On another device connected to the same network, open a web browser and enter the IP address or hostname of your Raspberry Pi followed by the port number where your JSFX app is running. For example, http://raspberrypi:3000.
You should see the web interface you created, allowing you to control the effects, adjust levels, and upload new effects.
Remember to adapt the code and instructions based on your specific requirements and the frameworks or libraries you choose to use.
Choose a scripting language: Decide whether you want to incorporate Lua or Python effects into your JSFX app. Both languages have their own advantages and ecosystem of audio processing libraries.
Install the necessary dependencies:
For Lua: Install Lua and the required Lua libraries for audio processing. One popular library for audio processing in Lua is LuaJIT.
For Python: Install Python and any necessary Python libraries for audio processing. Examples include NumPy, SciPy, and PyAudio.

Integrate the scripting language with your JSFX app:
For Lua: Within your JSFX app, use the jsfx.LuaScript API to execute Lua scripts and interact with the Lua-based audio effects. You can pass audio data between the JSFX engine and the Lua scripts to apply the desired audio processing.
For Python: Similarly, you can use the jsfx.PythonScript API within your JSFX app to execute Python scripts and handle the audio effects. This allows you to process audio data using Python libraries and pass the processed audio back to the JSFX engine.

Implement the scripting language effects:
Write the audio processing code in Lua or Python, depending on your chosen language. You can implement chorus, delay, reverb, or any other audio effects using the scripting language of your choice.
Ensure that the Lua or Python code receives the necessary audio input, performs the desired processing, and returns the processed audio to the JSFX engine for further processing or output.

Expose the necessary APIs:
Define the API endpoints or functions within your JSFX app's server code (e.g., app.js from the previous steps) to handle the interaction with Lua or Python effects. These endpoints should receive requests from the web interface or other components and execute the corresponding Lua or Python scripts with the appropriate inputs and parameters.

Incorporate the Lua/Python effects in the web interface:
Update your web interface (e.g., index.html) to include controls and options for selecting and configuring Lua or Python effects. These controls should send requests to the API endpoints you defined in the previous step, triggering the execution of the corresponding Lua or Python scripts.
By following these steps, you can incorporate Lua or Python effects into your JSFX app on a Raspberry Pi, allowing you to take advantage of the capabilities and libraries available in those scripting languages. Remember to handle any security considerations when exposing APIs and executing user-generated scripts.
